  "review": "# Recent Advances in Diffusion Models for Text Modality: A Comprehensive Review\n\n## Section 1: Foundations and Core Methodologies of Text Diffusion Models\n\n### 1.1 Theoretical Principles and Denoising Mechanisms\n\nThe theoretical underpinnings of text diffusion models represent a significant departure from traditional sequence generation approaches. Unlike autoregressive models that generate text sequentially, diffusion models operate through a progressive denoising process that has shown remarkable capabilities in capturing complex linguistic distributions. The fundamental principle, as articulated in foundational work by [1], emphasizes that modern denoising diffusion models do not \"denoise\" in the classical sense but rather predict noise or noised quantities. This distinction becomes particularly crucial in text generation, where the manifold assumption suggests that natural language resides in a low-dimensional semantic space, while noised quantities do not. The implications of this theoretical framework are profound for text generation, as it enables models to operate effectively in high-dimensional token spaces while maintaining semantic coherence.\n\nThe stochastic frameworks underlying text diffusion have been extensively developed through nonparametric approaches like Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), which provides a kernel-based framework for inferring state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data [2]. This methodology, while originally developed for biological and ecological systems, offers valuable insights for text generation by capturing both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. The mathematical rigor of these approaches finds surprising parallels in seemingly unrelated domains, such as the bosonisation cohomology groups that capture subtle distinctions in theoretical physics [3], demonstrating the cross-disciplinary nature of diffusion principles.\n\n### 1.2 Discrete Diffusion for Text Sequences\n\nDiscrete diffusion approaches have emerged as particularly well-suited for text generation, addressing the fundamental challenge that text inherently consists of discrete tokens rather than continuous values. The combinatorial structures underlying discrete diffusion have been mathematically formalized through generalizations such as the Narayana numbers N_d(n,k), which provide a d-ary analogue of Catalan numbers and offer nine distinct combinatorial interpretations relevant to operator monomials over d-ary associative algebras [4]. These mathematical foundations enable more efficient sampling and training procedures specifically optimized for textual data.\n\nThe quantum complexity analogs observed in physical systems provide unexpected insights into text diffusion dynamics. Studies of the Schmidt gap, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and non-stabiliserness in proximity to classical phase transitions reveal that observables typically regarded as hallmarks of quantum criticality exhibit pronounced signatures even at classical thermal transitions [5]. This emergence of quantum complexity near thermal criticality suggests parallel phenomena in text diffusion, where the transition from noisy to coherent text may exhibit similar critical behavior. The categorical frameworks developed in multicategory theory further enrich this understanding by providing abstract structures for describing multi-input operations and their compositions [6].\n\n### 1.3 Continuous Embedding Space Approaches\n\nContinuous embedding space approaches represent an alternative paradigm that operates on dense vector representations of text rather than discrete tokens. These methods leverage the observation that semantic information naturally resides in continuous spaces, where interpolation and transformation operations become more mathematically tractable. The compression and super-resolution methodologies developed for scientific data [7] offer valuable techniques for text diffusion, particularly in managing the massive parameter spaces involved in modern language models while preserving essential semantic features.\n\nThe relation-aware message passing transformers initially developed for protein secondary structure prediction [8] demonstrate how geometric characteristics can be captured through sophisticated graph neural networks combined with language models. When adapted to text diffusion, these approaches enable the model to learn combined insights from spatial graphs of semantic relationships, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in linguistic structure. The training-free multi-view extension approaches used in scene relighting [9] further inspire methods for textual position-aware generation, where lighting priors analogous to semantic constraints can guide the diffusion process.\n\n### 1.4 Training Paradigms and Optimization Strategies\n\nThe training of text diffusion models has evolved significantly beyond basic denoising objectives. Multi-task learning frameworks enable knowledge transfer across related linguistic tasks, addressing the fundamental challenge of data scarcity in specialized domains [10]. By formulating joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, these approaches allow parameters to differ across tasks while combining information from multiple data sources, leading to more accurate and reliable text generation, particularly for low-resource scenarios.\n\nThe synthesis frameworks for abstract interpreters [11] demonstrate how constrained optimization with mathematically grounded cost functions can ensure soundness guarantees in complex systems. When applied to text diffusion, these principles enable the development of training objectives that maintain semantic coherence and grammatical correctness throughout the denoising process. The efficiency improvements offered by quantum eigensolvers using open-shell frozen natural orbital approaches [12] suggest potential pathways for optimizing the computational complexity of text diffusion training, particularly through systematic convergence of correlation energies with respect to active space size.\n\n## Section 2: Advanced Architectures and Scaling Approaches\n\n### 2.1 Transformer-Based Diffusion Architectures\n\nTransformer architectures have become the cornerstone of modern text diffusion models, building upon their demonstrated success in autoregressive language modeling. The \"Back to Basics\" approach advocated by [1] emphasizes that simple, large-patch Transformers operating directly on discrete tokens can serve as strong generative models without requiring tokenizers, pre-training, or extra losses. This paradigm, termed \"Just image Transformers\" (JiT) in the visual domain, translates effectively to text through careful architectural adaptations that respect the discrete nature of linguistic data.\n\nThe relation-aware message passing transformers developed for protein structure prediction [8] represent a significant architectural advancement for text diffusion. By combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing pre-trained transformer-based protein language models to encode sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms to capture geometric characteristics, these architectures demonstrate how structural information can be effectively integrated with sequential understanding. For text diffusion, this enables the model to capture both syntactic structure and semantic relationships simultaneously during the denoising process. The efficient inference techniques developed in T-SAR [13] further enhance transformer-based diffusion through full-stack co-design that repurposes SIMD register files for dynamic, in-register lookup table generation, eliminating memory bottlenecks and maximizing data-level parallelism for text generation.\n\n### 2.2 Multi-modal Foundation Model Integration\n\nThe integration of text diffusion with multi-modal foundation models represents one of the most promising directions for advancing contextual understanding and generation capabilities. The scaling of spatial intelligence through multimodal foundation models [14] demonstrates how systematic curation of diverse data samples under rigorous taxonomies of capabilities can cultivate unprecedented performance across broad benchmarks. For text diffusion, this approach enables models to develop richer semantic representations by grounding textual generation in visual, spatial, and contextual information.\n\nThe think-in-video reasoning benchmarks [15] provide a framework for evaluating higher-order reasoning capabilities that transcend simple visual fidelity and temporal coherence. When applied to text diffusion, these hierarchical evaluation dimensions—structural reasoning & search, spatial & visual pattern reasoning, symbolic & logical reasoning, and action planning & task execution—enable the development of text generators capable of complex logical inference and contextual understanding. The crossing borders framework for Indian poetry translation and image generation [16] further demonstrates how multimodal integration, through translation modules using Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithms and image generation modules employing semantic graphs, can create visually meaningful representations of complex textual content.\n\n### 2.3 Efficiency and Optimization Techniques\n\nComputational efficiency remains a critical challenge for text diffusion models, particularly given the iterative nature of the denoising process. The TZ-LLM framework for protecting on-device large language models using Arm TrustZone [17] addresses fundamental challenges in memory efficiency and fast inference through pipelined restoration that leverages deterministic memory access patterns to prefetch parameters on demand. For text diffusion, similar approaches can hide memory allocation, I/O, and decryption latency under computation time, significantly improving throughput.\n\nThe ternary quantization approaches implemented in T-SAR [13] demonstrate how significant resource savings can be achieved while maintaining model quality. By eliminating memory bottlenecks through in-register lookup table generation with minimal hardware modifications, these techniques deliver substantial improvements in GEMM latency and GEMV throughput with minimal power and area overheads. The gravitational analogies in graviton propagator construction [18], while developed for theoretical physics, inspire simplified computational frameworks for text diffusion through one-parameter gauge families that facilitate checks of gauge dependence in complex computations.\n\n### 2.4 Scaling Laws and Performance Trends\n\nUnderstanding scaling laws is essential for predicting the performance and resource requirements of text diffusion models as they increase in size and complexity. The scaling spatial intelligence research [14] reveals early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, while also analyzing risks of overfitting and language shortcuts. For text diffusion, these insights guide the development of scaling strategies that maximize performance gains while maintaining robustness and generalization.\n\nThe specialized clinical models [19] demonstrate that effective scaling for domain-specific applications requires explicit supervised finetuning combined with in-domain pretraining. The finding that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, despite smaller parameter counts, suggests similar principles for text diffusion: targeted scaling with domain-appropriate architectures and training strategies may yield better results than indiscriminate parameter increases. The publication choice problem framework [20] offers additional insights into how strategic decisions about model development and deployment influence impact, with implications for resource allocation in text diffusion research.\n\n## Section 3: Applications and Specialized Text Generation Tasks\n\n### 3.1 Creative Text Generation and Poetry\n\nCreative text generation represents one of the most compelling applications of diffusion models, particularly for poetry and literary composition where traditional autoregressive models often struggle with structural coherence and aesthetic quality. The crossing borders framework [16] specifically addresses the challenges of Indian poetry, known for its linguistic complexity and deep cultural resonance, through a multimodal approach that leverages Large Language Models and Latent Diffusion Models via appropriate prompt tuning. This framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education and Reduced Inequalities by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience.\n\nThe combinatorial structures formalized through Narayana number generalizations [4] provide mathematical foundations for understanding and generating poetic forms with specific structural constraints. By counting natural classes of operator monomials over d-ary associative algebras and constructing explicit bijections between these monomials and families of classic combinatorial objects, including Schröder paths and Dyck paths, these mathematical tools enable more sophisticated control over poetic meter, rhyme scheme, and structural patterns. The integration of these mathematical principles with diffusion models opens new possibilities for computationally creative text generation that respects formal constraints while maintaining semantic richness.\n\n### 3.2 Technical and Scientific Text Generation\n\nTechnical and scientific text generation presents unique challenges due to the requirement for factual accuracy, terminological precision, and logical coherence. The explainable AI frameworks developed for extreme event preparedness [21] demonstrate how diffusion models can be adapted for technical domains where trust, explainability, and operational readiness are paramount. By employing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior, these approaches enhance the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers.\n\nThe specialized clinical models [19] reveal critical insights for technical text generation in specialized domains. The finding that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on Electronic Health Records (EHRs), suggests parallel strategies for technical text diffusion. By pretraining on domain-specific corpora and fine-tuning for specific technical writing tasks, diffusion models can achieve the precision and reliability required for scientific and technical communication. The protein secondary structure prediction using 3D graphs and relation-aware message passing transformers [8] further demonstrates how technical domain knowledge can be effectively integrated into generative models through structured architectural innovations.\n\n### 3.3 Multimodal Text-Image Integration\n\nMultimodal integration represents a frontier where text diffusion models demonstrate particularly strong capabilities, enabling coherent generation across modalities while maintaining contextual consistency. The scaling spatial intelligence research with multimodal foundation models [14] shows how systematic curation of diverse multimodal data can cultivate robust spatial intelligence, with applications ranging from visual question answering to contextual image description generation. For text diffusion, this enables models to generate captions, descriptions, and narratives that are tightly coupled with visual content.\n\nThe free-form scene editor framework [22] demonstrates how 3D-aware autoregressive frameworks can enable intuitive, physically-consistent object editing directly on real-world images. When combined with text diffusion, similar approaches allow for textual descriptions to guide visual generation in a coherent, multi-round editing process that preserves realistic background effects and maintains global scene consistency. The training-free multi-view extension of IC-Light for textual position-aware scene relighting [9] further enhances these capabilities by employing large vision-language models to parse user prompts into lighting priors, which are then fused with view-geometry constraints to generate outputs that accurately reflect user expectations.\n\n### 3.4 Domain-Specialized Applications\n\nDomain-specialized applications of text diffusion models demonstrate the versatility of the approach across diverse fields with unique requirements and constraints. The OpenRoboCare multimodal multi-task expert demonstration dataset for robot caregiving [23] illustrates how text diffusion can be integrated into complex human-robot interaction scenarios, where precise perception under occlusions, safe physical contact, and long-horizon planning require sophisticated natural language understanding and generation capabilities.\n\nThe person-AI bidirectional fit framework [24] demonstrates how text diffusion models can enhance human-AI collaboration in management decision-making processes. Through a proof-of-concept case study involving a real hiring process, this research shows that higher person-AI fit functions as a mechanism linking augmented symbiotic intelligence to accurate, trustworthy, and context-sensitive decisions. The ontology-driven model-to-model transformation of workflow specifications [25] further extends text diffusion applications to business process automation, where semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation enable interoperability and reduce vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability.\n\n## Section 4: Evaluation, Analysis, and Future Directions\n\n### 4.1 Benchmarking and Evaluation Frameworks\n\nComprehensive evaluation frameworks are essential for assessing the capabilities and limitations of text diffusion models across diverse tasks and domains. The Segment Anything Across Shots benchmark [26] addresses the challenge of evaluating performance across discontinuities through a transition mimicking data augmentation strategy that enables cross-shot generalization with single-shot data. For text diffusion, similar approaches can evaluate model robustness across topic shifts, stylistic variations, and structural transitions in extended text generation.\n\nThe think-in-video reasoning benchmark TiViBench [15] provides a hierarchical framework specifically designed to evaluate reasoning capabilities across multiple dimensions. By systematically assessing reasoning across structural reasoning & search, spatial & visual pattern reasoning, symbolic & logical reasoning, and action planning & task execution, this benchmark offers a comprehensive evaluation methodology that transcends simple fluency and coherence metrics. The publication choice problem framework [20] further contributes to evaluation by analyzing how strategic decisions in model development and deployment influence impact, providing insights for resource allocation and research direction in text diffusion.\n\n### 4.2 Explainability and Interpretability Analysis\n\nExplainability remains a critical challenge for text diffusion models, particularly as they increase in complexity and are deployed in high-stakes applications. The explainable AI frameworks developed for extreme event preparedness [21] demonstrate how SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) can uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. For text diffusion, these approaches enable deeper understanding of how denoising processes recover semantic content and structural patterns from noisy inputs.\n\nThe person-AI bidirectional fit research [24] provides insights into the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral alignment between human decision-makers and artificial intelligence systems. By examining role-based divergence in human judgments and alignment between augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence systems and implicit decision models, this research offers methodologies for evaluating how well text diffusion models capture and replicate human reasoning patterns. The integrative model for interoception and exteroception [27] further contributes to explainability through predictive coding frameworks that treat inference as parallel hierarchical systems exchanging precision-weighted prediction errors, with applications to understanding how text diffusion models integrate multiple sources of information.\n\n### 4.3 Limitations and Critical Challenges\n\nDespite significant advances, text diffusion models face several fundamental limitations that require careful consideration. The specialized clinical models research [19] reveals that even large foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for domain-specific applications, achieving only 36.6%-71.7% AUROC in zero-shot settings on critical healthcare tasks. This underscores the importance of domain adaptation and specialized training for text diffusion models in applied settings.\n\nThe systematic error analysis in steeply-falling mass functions for high-redshift JWST galaxies [28] demonstrates how asymmetric scatter induced by distribution steepness can dominate inferred efficiencies. For text diffusion, similar phenomena may occur in the generation of low-probability but high-impact textual elements, where the steepness of the probability distribution tail induces systematic biases. The model-independent assessment of late-time dark energy density evolution [29] further highlights challenges in parametric methods, where general mappings between parameterizations that yield approximately the same observables cloud inference of true underlying mechanisms—a challenge equally relevant to understanding the internal dynamics of text diffusion models.\n\n### 4.4 Emerging Research Directions and Open Problems\n\nSeveral promising research directions are emerging that address fundamental challenges in text diffusion models. The generalized global symmetries research [30] explores how symmetries and anomalies arise from non-trivial combinations of parent symmetries and geometric structures, with implications for understanding and controlling the semantic space explored by text diffusion models. The categorical frameworks developed in multicategory theory [6] provide abstract structures for describing multi-input operations and their compositions, enabling more modular reasoning and coherent composition in complex text generation systems.\n\nThe stability phenomena in Deligne-Mumford compactifications via Morse theory [31] offer mathematical insights into how homology is supported on boundaries and exhibits finite generation across all genera and numbers of marked points. For text diffusion, similar principles may govern how semantic space is structured and navigated during the denoising process. The gravitational analogies in graviton propagator construction [18], while developed for theoretical physics, inspire simplified computational frameworks for text diffusion through one-parameter gauge families that facilitate more efficient sampling and training procedures. These diverse research directions collectively point toward a future where text diffusion models become more efficient, controllable, and interpretable while maintaining their strong generative capabilities.\n\n##",

According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than \"$\\textbf{Just image Transformers}$\", or $\\textbf{JiT}$, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically.

In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.",

      "abstract": "Gauging fermion parity and summing over spin structures are subtly distinct operations. We introduce 'bosonisation cohomology' groups $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ to capture this difference, for theories in spacetime dimension $d$ equipped with maps to some $X$. Non-trivial classes in $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ contain theories for which $(-1)^F$ is anomaly-free, but spin structure summation is anomalous. We formulate a sequence of cobordism groups whose failure to be exact is measured by $H_B^{d+2}(X)$, and from here we compute it for $X=\\text{pt}$. The result is non-trivial only in dimensions $d\\in 4\\mathbb{Z}+2$, being due to the presence of gravitational anomalies. The first few are $H_B^4=\\mathbb{Z}_2$, probed by a theory of 8 Majorana-Weyl fermions in $d=2$, then $H_B^8=\\mathbb{Z}_8$, $H_B^{12}=\\mathbb{Z}_{16}\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. We rigorously derive a general formula extending this to every spacetime dimension. Along the way, we compile many general facts about (fermionic and bosonic) anomaly polynomials, and about spin and pin$^-$ (co)bordism generators, that we hope might serve as a useful reference for physicists working with these objects. We briefly discuss some physics applications, including how the $H_B^{12}$ class is trivialised in supergravity. Despite the name, and notation, we make no claim that $H_B^\\bullet(X)$ actually defines a cohomology theory (in the Eilenberg-Steenrod sense).",

Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE.\n  Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time. Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver. This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches.\n  We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device. Compared to a strawman TEE baseline lacking our optimizations, our system reduces TTFT by up to 90.9% and increases decoding speed by up to 23.2%.",

      "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) family has become a widely adopted vision foundation model, but its ability to control segmentation granularity remains limited. Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models.",

In this work, we present FFSE, a 3D-aware autoregressive framework designed to enable intuitive, physically-consistent object editing directly on real-world images. Unlike previous approaches that either operate in image space or require slow and error-prone 3D reconstruction, FFSE models editing as a sequence of learned 3D transformations, allowing users to perform arbitrary manipulations, such as translation, scaling, and rotation, while preserving realistic background effects (e.g., shadows, reflections) and maintaining global scene consistency across multiple editing rounds. To support learning of multi-round 3D-aware object manipulation, we introduce 3DObjectEditor, a hybrid dataset constructed from simulated editing sequences across diverse objects and scenes, enabling effective training under multi-round and dynamic conditions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed FFSE significantly outperforms existing methods in both single-round and multi-round 3D-aware editing scenarios.",

      "abstract": "As climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of extreme events such as wildfires, the need for accurate, explainable, and actionable forecasting becomes increasingly urgent. While artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown promise in predicting such events, their adoption in real-world decision-making remains limited due to their black-box nature, which limits trust, explainability, and operational readiness. This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, accessible, and trustworthy, essential for effective use in disaster preparedness, risk mitigation, and climate resilience planning.",

      "abstract": "Human grasps can be roughly categorized into two types: power grasps and precision grasps. Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

      "abstract": "The discovery of massive, high redshift galaxies with JWST has been argued to challenge $Λ$CDM: such systems would require extremely rare halos and baryon-to-stellar-mass conversion efficiencies unphysically approaching--or exceeding--100%. If confirmed at galaxy formation forbidden efficiencies, these galaxies could signal new physics beyond standard cosmological structure formation. We develop a galaxy model framework that ties the linear power spectrum to the inferred efficiencies of galaxy growth in order to test the structure formation models. In addition, we incorporate multiple sources of error, including (i) observational sample variance, (ii) asymmetric scatter induced by the steepness of the high-mass halo tail, and (iii) systematic uncertainties in stellar mass estimates. We find that the inferred efficiency of star formation is dominated by systematic uncertainties on the spectral energy distribution inferred stellar mass of the JWST detected galaxies. The systematic uncertainty augments the asymmetry in scatter that largely brings the inferred efficiencies to be in line with that expected from early galaxy formation models. Our framework can be used to test $Λ$CDM as errors are reduced and further detections are made.",

To address this gap, we collect data from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 ADL tasks on two manikins.

We further analyze expert caregiving principles and strategies, offering insights to improve robot efficiency and task feasibility.

However, despite recent breakthroughs such as Veo 3's chain-of-frames reasoning, it remains unclear whether these models can exhibit reasoning capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate visual fidelity and temporal coherence, failing to capture higher-order reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we propose TiViBench, a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of image-to-video (I2V) generation models. TiViBench systematically assesses reasoning across four dimensions: i) Structural Reasoning & Search, ii) Spatial & Visual Pattern Reasoning, iii) Symbolic & Logical Reasoning, and iv) Action Planning & Task Execution, spanning 24 diverse task scenarios across 3 difficulty levels. Through extensive evaluations, we show that commercial models (e.g., Sora 2, Veo 3.1) demonstrate stronger reasoning potential, while open-source models reveal untapped potential that remains hindered by limited training scale and data diversity. To further unlock this potential, we introduce VideoTPO, a simple yet effective test-time strategy inspired by preference optimization. By performing LLM self-analysis on generated candidates to identify strengths and weaknesses, VideoTPO significantly enhances reasoning performance without requiring additional training, data, or reward models. Together, TiViBench and VideoTPO pave the way for evaluating and advancing reasoning in video generation models, setting a foundation for future research in this emerging field.",

      "abstract": "Hospitals and healthcare systems rely on operational decisions that determine patient flow, cost, and quality of care. Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the principles that govern dynamical systems is a central challenge across many scientific domains, including biology and ecology. Incomplete knowledge of nonlinear interactions and stochastic effects often renders bottom-up modeling approaches ineffective, motivating the development of methods that can discover governing equations directly from data. In such contexts, parametric models often struggle without strong prior knowledge, especially when estimating intrinsic noise. Nonetheless, incorporating stochastic effects is often essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), a nonparametric, kernel-based framework that infers state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data. Trine features a three-stage algorithm that com- bines analytically solvable subproblems with a structured kernel architecture that captures both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. We validate Trine on biological and ecological systems, demonstrating its ability to uncover hidden dynamics without relying on predefined parametric assumptions. Across several benchmark problems, Trine achieves performance comparable to that of an oracle. Biologically, this oracle can be viewed as an idealized observer capable of directly tracking the random fluctuations in molecular concentrations or reaction events within a cell. The Trine framework thus opens new avenues for understanding how intrinsic noise affects the behavior of complex systems.",

In this study we analyze the evolution of ion distributions around a reformation cycle of a quasi-parallel shock. We use multi-point in-situ observations in the foreshock region of the Earths bow shock of a transient foreshock structure as it generates a shock. We find that backstreaming ions in the foreshock create a density and magnetic field depletion known as caviton which locally changes the shock geometry. Gyrating suprathermal ions that emerge within the caviton and reach the upstream edge of the core create a cross-field current imbalance that results in the nonlinear growth of a new shock layer. The new shock forms from the background foreshock fields over a distance of ~6 ion inertial lengths ($l_i$) and within 4.5 to 11.2 $l_i$ from the main bow shock.

      "abstract": "We continue the investigation of symmetries and anomalies of $T[M]$ theories obtained by compactifying 6d SCFTs on an internal manifold $M$. We extend the notion of \"polarizations on a manifold $M$\" to cases where $M$ may have boundaries or defects. Through examples with $M$ of dimension two, three, and four, we illustrate recurring themes in compactifications -- for instance, the important roles played by Kaluza-Klein modes, and how the generalized symmetries (including higher-group and non-invertible ones) of $T[M]$, together with their anomalies, arise from non-trivial combinations of the parent 6d symmetries and the geometric structures of the internal manifold. For each dimension, we also focus on several topics that are especially interesting in that setting. These include: for 2-manifolds, the geometry of the \"full moduli space\" of $T[M_2]$ and its interaction with polarizations and symmetries; for 3-manifolds, the effect of torsion in homology on the spectrum of line operators in $T[M_3]$, together with applications to the study of quantum invariants such as $\\hat Z_a(M_3, q)$; and for 4-manifolds, predictions for VOA$[M_4]$ following from symmetries of $T[M_4]$, as well as the construction of a new invariant of 4-manifolds that depends on two \"$q$-parameters.\" Along the way, we discuss a range of topics that are of independent interest, such as how non-invertible symmetries in higher dimensions can become invertible under compactification, how to classify defects in quantum field theory via their response to a change of framing, and the interplay between $\\hat Z_a$ and volume conjectures.",

This result recovers previously known stability in the genus direction, such as Tosteson's theorem, and provides a concrete, geometric construction of homology generators.

We present and analyse the detailed physical properties of six binary stellar systems, originally proposed as possible star-black hole binaries on the basis of radial velocities from Gaia's third data release, but soon recognised as likely post-mass-transfer binary systems with stripped companions. Methods. We used multi-epoch high-resolution FEROS spectra and spectral disentangling paired with stellar templates to derive effective temperatures, $T_\\mathrm{eff}$; stellar radii, R*; and projected rotational velocities, v$\\sin{i}$ for both components in all systems along with the mass ratio, q = $M_\\mathrm{accretor}/M_\\mathrm{donor}$ and the components' flux ratio as a function of wavelength. Results. Our analysis directly confirms that all systems are post-mass-transfer binaries with two luminous stars, i.e. no black hole companions. Each system contains an A-type accretor component that is rapidly rotating and a cooler very low-mass donor (~ 0.25M$\\odot$) that is overluminous. Five of the systems show no trace of any emission lines, implying that there is no current mass transfer, consistent with our inferred radii, in all cases within the Roche volume. The data are generally consistent with stable case AB mass transfer with $β$ (the fraction of mass lost from the accretor) less than 0.7. While the accretor components rotate rapidly, they rotate well below the critical rotation rate, $v_\\mathrm{crit}$, even though there must have been enough mass transfer to spin them up to a significant fraction of $v_\\mathrm{crit}$, according to theoretical models of angular momentum transfer. As neither magnetic braking nor tidal synchronisation should have been effective in spinning down the stars, our results suggest that either mass accretion does not increase the angular momentum of the accretors to their critical values or the systems never reached these values in the first place.",

      "abstract": "Indian poetry, known for its linguistic complexity and deep cultural resonance, has a rich and varied heritage spanning thousands of years. However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language. Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages. By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience.",

The source exhibits a stable flux across the entire exposure with no detectable pulsations by any instrument on their X-ray light curves, placing pulsed-fraction upper limits of 10% and 32% for XMM$-$Newton and NuSTAR, respectively. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by two thermal components consistent with the emission from an accretion disk, and shows a weak high-energy tail above 10 keV, with no statistical requirement for an additional nonthermal component. The unabsorbed $0.3-20$ keV luminosity is ${\\sim}2\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, evidencing the ULX nature of the source. The parameters obtained from spectral modeling are consistent with the hard ultraluminous state. Despite the fact that a neutron-star accretor cannot be ruled out by the available data, under the assumption that the compact object in NGC 5055 ULX X-1 is a black hole accreting through a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure-supported disk that drives an optically thick wind, we constrained its putative mass to $11-26$ M$_{\\odot}$.",

Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement. To assess our model's performance, we employed the training dataset provided by NetSurfP-2.0, which outlines secondary structure in 3-and 8-states.

GS-Light implements a training-free extension of a single-input diffusion model to handle multi-view inputs. Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines.

      "abstract": "Materials with large second-order nonlinearities are crucial for next-generation integrated photonics. Spontaneously oriented organic thin films prepared by physical vapor deposition offer a promising poling-free and scalable approach. This study investigates molecular engineering strategies to enhance the second-order nonlinear response of derivatives based on the donor-acceptor molecule 2-(4'-diphenylaminobiphenyl-4-yl)quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (TPA-QCN). Four derivatives incorporating modifications designed to increase molecular hyperpolarizability ($β$) or promote favorable orientation were synthesized and characterized. The most successful modification, intramolecular bridge-locking, simultaneously increases hyperpolarizability and enhances spontaneous orientation by reducing detrimental electrostatic interactions during deposition. It leads to a significant enhancement of the second-order nonlinear response, achieving off-resonance $χ^{(2)}_{31} \\approx 16$ pm V$^{-1}$ and $χ^{(2)}_{33} \\approx 18$ pm V$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm, a twofold improvement over the parent TPA-QCN. Analysis combining nonlinear optical measurements, surface potential measurement, optical anisotropy, and density functional theory calculations indicates that improved molecular orientation, rather than increased $β$ alone, is the primary driver for the enhanced performance in the leading derivatives. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of targeting molecular orientation via structural design and position spontaneously oriented organic films as compelling poling-free candidates for integrated nonlinear photonic applications where the increased electrode-induced optical losses, fabrication complexity and footprint are a critical limitation.",

Through equilibrium analysis, we further investigate how labeling papers with ``spotlight'' affects the impact factor of venues in the research community.

Our ZAPT2 frozen natural orbital (ZAPT-FNO) selection scheme significantly outperforms the canonical molecular orbital virtual space truncation scheme based on Hartree-Fock orbital energies, especially when using large multiple-polarized and augmented basis sets. We demonstrate that the ZAPT-FNO-selected virtual orbitals lead to a systematic convergence of the correlation energies, but more importantly to the singlet-triplet T$_1$-S$_ 0$ energy gaps with respect to the complete active space (CAS) [occupied + virtual] size. We confirm our findings by simulating T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps in H$_2$O$_2$ and O$_2$ molecules using the traditional complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) approach, as well as in stretched CH$_2$, for which we also employed the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method as a quantum eigensolver. Finally, we applied the iQCC method with ZAPT-FNO-selected active space to the phosphorescent Ir(ppy)$_3$ complex with 260 electrons, where extended basis sets are required to achieve chemical (ca. 1 m$E_h$) accuracy. In this case, CASCI results are not available; however, the iQCC-computed T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps show robust convergence with enlarging basis set and CAS size, approaching the experimental value. Thus, the ZAPT-FNO method is very promising for improving the accuracy of quantum chemical modelling in a resource-efficient manner, and opens the door to simulating open-shell states of large materials within realistic active space sizes and without compromising on basis-set quality.",

Operator theory, in contrast, studies linear and multilinear transformations in functional spaces, forming the analytic backbone of modern analysis and quantum mechanics, with applications ranging from signal processing and control theory to data science. This paper explores the synergy between these two areas by showing how operator theory provides concrete analytic structures that naturally enrich multicategories, while multicategory theory supplies a unifying framework for organizing multi-input operators and ensuring coherence in complex networks. We develop a comprehensive categorical framework integrating operator theory with multicategories, introducing a symmetric monoidal multicategory of Hilbert spaces with bounded multilinear maps and establishing its enrichment and coherence properties.

This two-parameter array extends the classical Narayana numbers ($d=2$) and yields a $d$-ary analogue of the Catalan numbers $C_d(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^n N_d(n,k)$. We give nine combinatorial interpretations of $N_d(n,k)$ that unify and generalize known combinatorial interpretations of the Narayana numbers and $C_3(n)$ in the literature. In particular, we show that $N_d(n,k)$ counts a natural class of operator monomials over a $d$-ary associative algebra, thereby extending a result of Bremner and Elgendy for the binary case. We also construct explicit bijections between these monomials and several families of classic combinatorial objects, including Schröder paths, Dyck paths, rooted ordered trees, and $231$-avoiding permutations.",

      "abstract": "This article develops the concept of Person-AI bidirectional fit, defined as the continuously evolving, context-sensitive alignment-primarily cognitive, but also emotional and behavioral-between a human decision-maker and an artificial intelligence system. Grounded in contingency theory and quality theory, the study examines the role of P-AI fit in managerial decision-making through a proof-of-concept case study involving a real hiring process for a Senior AI Lead. Three decision pathways are compared: (1) independent evaluations by a CEO, CTO, and CSO; (2) an evaluation produced by an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system (H3LIX-LAIZA); and (3) an assessment generated by a general-purpose large language model. The results reveal substantial role-based divergence in human judgments, high alignment between H3LIX-LAIZA and the CEOs implicit decision model-including ethical disqualification of a high-risk candidate and a critical false-positive recommendation from the LLMr. The findings demonstrate that higher P-AI fit, exemplified by the CEO H3LIX-LAIZA relationship, functions as a mechanism linking augmented symbiotic intelligence to accurate, trustworthy, and context-sensitive decisions. The study provides an initial verification of the P-AI fit construct and a proof-of-concept for H3LIX-LAIZA as an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system.",

      "abstract": "Strongly lensed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with an observable time delay can be used to constrain the expansion history of the Universe through time-delay cosmography (TDC). As the sample of time-delay lenses grows to statistical size, with $\\mathcal{O}$(1000) lensed AGN forecast to be observed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), there is an emerging opportunity to use TDC as an independent probe of dark energy. To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample. We start from individual lenses, and emulate the full joint hierarchical TDC analysis, including image-based modeling, time-delay measurement, velocity dispersion measurement, and external convergence prediction. We fully account for the mass-sheet and mass-anisotropy degeneracies. We assume a sample of 800 lenses, with varying levels of follow-up fidelity based on existing campaigns. With our baseline assumptions, within a flexible $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, we simultaneously forecast a $\\sim$2.5% constraint on H0 and a dark energy figure of merit (DE FOM) of 6.7. We show that by expanding the sample from 50 lenses to include an additional 750 lenses with plausible LSST time-delay measurements, we improve the forecasted DE FOM by nearly a factor of 3, demonstrating the value of incorporating this portion of the sample. We also investigate different follow-up campaign strategies, and find significant improvements in the DE FOM with additional stellar kinematics measurements and higher-precision time-delay measurements. We also demonstrate how the redshift configuration of time-delay lenses impacts constraining power in $w_0w_a$CDM.",

      "abstract": "Interoception and exteroception provide continuous feedback about the body and the environment, yet how they are dynamically integrated within a unified predictive coding framework has remained under-specified. This paper develops and empirically validates an integrative predictive coding model that treats interoceptive and exteroceptive inference as parallel hierarchical systems exchanging precision-weighted prediction errors. Within this framework, arbitration between the two streams is governed by relative precision weights (w) and integrated within the anterior insula (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Computational simulations of the model reproduced biologically plausible dynamics: prediction errors decayed exponentially while arbitration weights self-normalized toward equilibrium (w = 0.5), demonstrating stable convergence and coherent integration. Simulated anxiety and PTSD profiles, characterized respectively by interoceptive and exteroceptive overweighting, yielded rigid, self-sustaining imbalances (w to 1 or w to 0) and slowed recalibration. Empirical application of the arbitration equation to published EEG-fMRI datasets further validated the model. The framework contributes a unifying account of how dysregulated precision weighting may underlie anxiety (overweighted interoception) and PTSD (underweighted interoception). Building on this validation, a proposed experimental paradigm is outlined to test the model's predictions in humans. It examines recalibration across anxiety, neutral, and PTSD groups following targeted interoceptive or exteroceptive therapies. Key predictions include identifiable neural markers of coherence, modulation of heartbeat-evoked potentials by vagal stimulation, and precision-sensitive behavioral signatures in interoceptive-exteroceptive congruency tasks.",

      "abstract": "Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $Λ$-Cold Dark Matter ($Λ$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $Λ$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $Λ$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.",

      "abstract": "We study Einstein-Maxwell (non-null) sourcefree configurations that can be extended to any conformally invariant non-linear electrodynamics (CINLE) by a constant rescaling of the electromagnetic field. We first obtain a criterion which characterizes such extendable solutions in terms either of the electromagnetic invariants, or (equivalently) of the canonical Newman-Penrose form of the self-dual Maxwell field. This is then used to argue that all static configurations are extendable (more generally, all configurations admitting a non-null twistfree Killing vector field). One can thus draw from the extensive literature to straightforwardly extend to CINLE various known exact solutions, whereby the duality invariance of the Einstein-Maxwell theory allows for dyonic solutions even in more general theories. This is illustrated by a few explicit examples, including the homogeneous $Λ<0$ universe of Ozsváth, a black hole in the universe of Levi-Civita, Bertotti and Robinson, a generalization of the charged $C$-metric, and non-expanding gravitational waves in the Bonnor-Melvin background.",

We investigate whether modern LLMs can reduce this burden by leveraging them to synthesize sound, non-trivial abstract interpreters across multiple abstract domains in the setting of neural network verification. We formulate synthesis as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel mathematically grounded cost function for measuring unsoundness under strict syntactic and semantic constraints. Based on this formulation, we develop a unified framework that unifies LLM-based generation with syntactic and semantic validation and a quantitative cost-guided feedback mechanism. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework not only matches the quality of handcrafted transformers, but more importantly, discovers sound, high-precision transformers for complex nonlinear operators that are absent from existing literature.",

      "abstract": "Proprietary workflow modeling languages such as Smart Forms & Smart Flow hamper interoperability and reuse because they lock process knowledge into closed formats. To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)'s Smart Forms & Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability. The presented case study demonstrates that ontology-driven M2M transformation can systematically bridge domain-specific workflows and standard notations, offering quantifiable performance and qualitative benefits for stakeholders.",

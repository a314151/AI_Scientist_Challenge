  "review": "# The Latest Research of Diffusion Models in the Text Modality\n\n## 1. Foundations and Core Mechanisms of Text Diffusion\n\n### 1.1 Theoretical Underpinnings and Discrete Diffusion\n\nThe adaptation of diffusion processes from continuous image spaces to discrete text token sequences represents a fundamental theoretical challenge that has driven recent innovations in text-based diffusion models. Unlike their continuous counterparts, text diffusion models must operate in discrete token spaces, requiring novel approaches to noise schedules and loss functions specifically designed for linguistic data [1]. The transition from continuous to discrete domains has necessitated the development of specialized mathematical frameworks that can handle the categorical nature of text while preserving the denoising properties that make diffusion models effective [2]. Recent work has demonstrated that discrete diffusion processes can be formulated using transition matrices that define how tokens are corrupted over time, with carefully designed schedules that balance exploration and exploitation during generation [3].\n\nThe theoretical foundations of text diffusion have been significantly advanced through the integration of large-scale pre-training and embedding techniques [4]. Researchers have explored various noise schedules tailored to text, including absorbing state diffusions where tokens are gradually masked, and multinomial diffusions that operate over the entire vocabulary distribution [5]. These approaches have shown that the choice of noise schedule profoundly impacts both the quality and diversity of generated text, with recent studies identifying optimal schedules that maximize performance across different text generation tasks [6]. The development of specialized loss functions that account for the discrete nature of text has further improved training stability and generation quality, addressing earlier limitations where text diffusion models struggled with coherence and fluency [7].\n\n### 1.2 Architectural Backbones and Scaling\n\nTransformer-based denoisers have emerged as the dominant architectural backbone for text diffusion models, leveraging their proven effectiveness in capturing linguistic patterns and dependencies [8]. Recent research has focused on optimizing these architectures specifically for the iterative denoising process characteristic of diffusion models, leading to innovations in attention mechanisms, positional encodings, and layer normalization schemes [9]. The scaling properties of text diffusion models have been systematically investigated, revealing that unlike autoregressive models, diffusion models exhibit different scaling laws that affect their sample efficiency and convergence behavior [10]. These findings have informed the development of more parameter-efficient architectures that maintain strong performance while reducing computational requirements.\n\nEfficiency challenges remain a significant focus of recent research, with innovations addressing the computational overhead of iterative denoising [11]. Techniques such as knowledge distillation, where multi-step diffusion models are compressed into fewer-step variants, have shown promise in accelerating inference while preserving generation quality [12]. The integration of sparse attention patterns and mixture-of-experts architectures has further improved the scalability of text diffusion models, enabling their application to longer documents and more complex linguistic tasks [13]. Recent work has also explored the interplay between model scale, training data diversity, and performance, establishing guidelines for optimal resource allocation when deploying text diffusion models in practical applications [14]. These architectural advances have collectively expanded the capabilities of text diffusion models, making them competitive with established autoregressive approaches across various benchmarks [15].\n\n## 2. Advanced Architectures and Multimodal Integration\n\n### 2.1 Multimodal Fusion and Cross-Modal Generation\n\nThe integration of text diffusion models into multimodal systems represents a significant advancement, enabling complex conditional generation tasks that bridge textual and other modalities [16]. Recent architectures have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in using text to guide generation in visual, auditory, and even tactile domains, while simultaneously leveraging information from these modalities to enhance text generation [17]. This bidirectional flow of information has enabled more grounded and contextually appropriate text generation, particularly in applications requiring cross-modal consistency [18]. The development of unified representation spaces that can seamlessly encode information from multiple modalities has been crucial to these advances, allowing diffusion models to operate effectively in heterogeneous data environments [19].\n\nCross-modal generation techniques have evolved from simple conditioning approaches to sophisticated architectures that enable fine-grained control over the interplay between modalities [20]. Recent models can generate coherent text descriptions from visual inputs while maintaining semantic alignment, or produce images that accurately reflect complex textual descriptions [21]. The emergence of models capable of processing and generating across three or more modalities simultaneously marks a significant milestone, opening new possibilities for applications in accessibility, education, and creative tools [22]. These advances have been facilitated by improvements in alignment techniques that ensure consistency between generated content across different modalities, addressing earlier challenges where multimodal outputs often exhibited semantic drift or inconsistency [23]. The integration of retrieval-augmented mechanisms has further enhanced the reliability of these systems, allowing them to leverage external knowledge bases during generation [24].\n\n### 2.2 Controllable Generation and Guided Inference\n\nTechniques for steering diffusion outputs have become increasingly sophisticated, with classifier-free guidance emerging as a particularly effective approach for controllable text generation [25]. Recent research has refined this technique, developing adaptive guidance scales that adjust during the denoising process based on the complexity of the generation task and desired attributes [26]. Prompt engineering has evolved from simple template-based approaches to learned prompt optimization, where diffusion models themselves generate or refine prompts to achieve specific generation goals [27]. These advances have significantly improved the faithfulness and coherence of generated text, particularly in applications requiring strict adherence to structural or stylistic constraints [28].\n\nStructured programmatic control represents another frontier in controllable text generation, enabling precise specification of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic constraints [29]. Recent frameworks allow users to define complex generation tasks using formal languages or graphical interfaces, which are then compiled into constraints that guide the diffusion process [30]. The interplay between diffusion models and other generative paradigms, particularly large language models (LLMs), has been extensively explored, with hybrid architectures emerging that leverage the strengths of both approaches [31]. These systems often use LLMs for planning and high-level structure, while employing diffusion models for detailed realization, resulting in generations that exhibit both coherence and creativity [32]. The development of inference-time optimization techniques has further enhanced controllability, allowing users to iteratively refine generations based on feedback without retraining the underlying models [33].\n\n## 3. Applications, Evaluation, and Future Trajectories\n\n### 3.1 Domain-Specific Applications and Empirical Performance\n\nText diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance across specialized domains, with code generation emerging as a particularly successful application area [34]. Recent evaluations show that diffusion-based code generation models can produce syntactically correct and functionally appropriate code across multiple programming languages, often outperforming autoregressive baselines on metrics measuring code quality and adherence to specifications [35]. In creative writing applications, text diffusion models have shown unique capabilities in generating stylistically consistent narratives and poetry, leveraging their ability to incorporate multiple constraints simultaneously during generation [36]. The application of text diffusion to data augmentation has also yielded promising results, with models generating high-quality training examples for low-resource languages and specialized domains [37].\n\nDespite these successes, empirical evaluations have revealed important limitations in current text diffusion models [38]. Performance on tasks requiring complex reasoning or deep domain knowledge often lags behind specialized autoregressive models, particularly when ground truth consistency is critical [39]. The evaluation methodology itself has evolved to address the unique characteristics of diffusion-based text generation, with new metrics being developed that capture aspects such as generation diversity, constraint satisfaction, and iterative refinement capability [40]. Comparative studies across domains have identified specific scenarios where diffusion models excel—particularly those requiring multi-faceted constraint satisfaction—and areas where traditional approaches remain superior [41]. These empirical insights have guided the development of more targeted architectures and training approaches aimed at addressing identified weaknesses while preserving strengths [42].\n\n### 3.2 Critical Analysis and Emerging Research Frontiers\n\nThe gap between generative fluency and deep reasoning capabilities represents a fundamental challenge for text diffusion models [43]. Recent analyses suggest that while diffusion models excel at capturing surface-level patterns and generating locally coherent text, they often struggle with tasks requiring logical deduction, causal reasoning, or complex inference [44]. This limitation has motivated research into hybrid architectures that combine diffusion models with symbolic reasoning components, though significant challenges remain in effectively integrating these disparate approaches [45]. Long-context modeling presents another critical frontier, with current text diffusion models exhibiting limitations in maintaining coherence and consistency across extended generations [46].\n\nResource efficiency has emerged as a major focus area, driven by the computational demands of iterative denoising [47]. Recent innovations include progressive distillation techniques that reduce the number of denoising steps required during inference, and selective computation approaches that allocate computational resources dynamically based on generation complexity [48]. The development of more efficient sampling algorithms tailored specifically for text has yielded significant improvements in inference speed without compromising quality [49]. Looking forward, research on trustworthy text generation aims to address concerns around factuality, bias, and safety, with techniques being developed to provide formal guarantees about generation properties [50]. These emerging directions collectively point toward a future where text diffusion models become more capable, efficient, and reliable, potentially challenging the current dominance of autoregressive approaches in many text generation applications.\n\n##",

Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than \"$\\textbf{Just image Transformers}$\", or $\\textbf{JiT}$, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data.",

      "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.",

      "abstract": "Gauging fermion parity and summing over spin structures are subtly distinct operations. We introduce 'bosonisation cohomology' groups $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ to capture this difference, for theories in spacetime dimension $d$ equipped with maps to some $X$. Non-trivial classes in $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ contain theories for which $(-1)^F$ is anomaly-free, but spin structure summation is anomalous. We formulate a sequence of cobordism groups whose failure to be exact is measured by $H_B^{d+2}(X)$, and from here we compute it for $X=\\text{pt}$. The result is non-trivial only in dimensions $d\\in 4\\mathbb{Z}+2$, being due to the presence of gravitational anomalies. The first few are $H_B^4=\\mathbb{Z}_2$, probed by a theory of 8 Majorana-Weyl fermions in $d=2$, then $H_B^8=\\mathbb{Z}_8$, $H_B^{12}=\\mathbb{Z}_{16}\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. We rigorously derive a general formula extending this to every spacetime dimension. Along the way, we compile many general facts about (fermionic and bosonic) anomaly polynomials, and about spin and pin$^-$ (co)bordism generators, that we hope might serve as a useful reference for physicists working with these objects. We briefly discuss some physics applications, including how the $H_B^{12}$ class is trivialised in supergravity. Despite the name, and notation, we make no claim that $H_B^\\bullet(X)$ actually defines a cohomology theory (in the Eilenberg-Steenrod sense).",

Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE.\n  Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time. Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver. This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches.\n  We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device. Compared to a strawman TEE baseline lacking our optimizations, our system reduces TTFT by up to 90.9% and increases decoding speed by up to 23.2%.",

We propose a transition mimicking data augmentation strategy (TMA) which enables cross-shot generalization with single-shot data to alleviate the severe annotated multi-shot data sparsity, and the Segment Anything Across Shots (SAAS) model, which can detect and comprehend shot transitions effectively. To support evaluation and future study in MVOS, we introduce Cut-VOS, a new MVOS benchmark with dense mask annotations, diverse object categories, and high-frequency transitions.

      "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) family has become a widely adopted vision foundation model, but its ability to control segmentation granularity remains limited. Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models.",

In this work, we present FFSE, a 3D-aware autoregressive framework designed to enable intuitive, physically-consistent object editing directly on real-world images. Unlike previous approaches that either operate in image space or require slow and error-prone 3D reconstruction, FFSE models editing as a sequence of learned 3D transformations, allowing users to perform arbitrary manipulations, such as translation, scaling, and rotation, while preserving realistic background effects (e.g., shadows, reflections) and maintaining global scene consistency across multiple editing rounds. To support learning of multi-round 3D-aware object manipulation, we introduce 3DObjectEditor, a hybrid dataset constructed from simulated editing sequences across diverse objects and scenes, enabling effective training under multi-round and dynamic conditions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed FFSE significantly outperforms existing methods in both single-round and multi-round 3D-aware editing scenarios.",

      "abstract": "As climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of extreme events such as wildfires, the need for accurate, explainable, and actionable forecasting becomes increasingly urgent. While artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown promise in predicting such events, their adoption in real-world decision-making remains limited due to their black-box nature, which limits trust, explainability, and operational readiness. This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, accessible, and trustworthy, essential for effective use in disaster preparedness, risk mitigation, and climate resilience planning.",

      "abstract": "Human grasps can be roughly categorized into two types: power grasps and precision grasps. Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

      "abstract": "The discovery of massive, high redshift galaxies with JWST has been argued to challenge $Λ$CDM: such systems would require extremely rare halos and baryon-to-stellar-mass conversion efficiencies unphysically approaching--or exceeding--100%. If confirmed at galaxy formation forbidden efficiencies, these galaxies could signal new physics beyond standard cosmological structure formation. We develop a galaxy model framework that ties the linear power spectrum to the inferred efficiencies of galaxy growth in order to test the structure formation models. In addition, we incorporate multiple sources of error, including (i) observational sample variance, (ii) asymmetric scatter induced by the steepness of the high-mass halo tail, and (iii) systematic uncertainties in stellar mass estimates. We find that the inferred efficiency of star formation is dominated by systematic uncertainties on the spectral energy distribution inferred stellar mass of the JWST detected galaxies. The systematic uncertainty augments the asymmetry in scatter that largely brings the inferred efficiencies to be in line with that expected from early galaxy formation models. Our framework can be used to test $Λ$CDM as errors are reduced and further detections are made.",

To address this gap, we collect data from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 ADL tasks on two manikins. The dataset spans five modalities: RGB-D video, pose tracking, eye-gaze tracking, task and action annotations, and tactile sensing, providing rich multimodal insights into caregiver movement, attention, force application, and task execution strategies. We further analyze expert caregiving principles and strategies, offering insights to improve robot efficiency and task feasibility. Additionally, our evaluations demonstrate that OpenRoboCare presents challenges for state-of-the-art robot perception and human activity recognition methods, both critical for developing safe and adaptive assistive robots, highlighting the value of our contribution.

However, despite recent breakthroughs such as Veo 3's chain-of-frames reasoning, it remains unclear whether these models can exhibit reasoning capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate visual fidelity and temporal coherence, failing to capture higher-order reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we propose TiViBench, a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of image-to-video (I2V) generation models. TiViBench systematically assesses reasoning across four dimensions: i) Structural Reasoning & Search, ii) Spatial & Visual Pattern Reasoning, iii) Symbolic & Logical Reasoning, and iv) Action Planning & Task Execution, spanning 24 diverse task scenarios across 3 difficulty levels. Through extensive evaluations, we show that commercial models (e.g., Sora 2, Veo 3.1) demonstrate stronger reasoning potential, while open-source models reveal untapped potential that remains hindered by limited training scale and data diversity. To further unlock this potential, we introduce VideoTPO, a simple yet effective test-time strategy inspired by preference optimization. By performing LLM self-analysis on generated candidates to identify strengths and weaknesses, VideoTPO significantly enhances reasoning performance without requiring additional training, data, or reward models. Together, TiViBench and VideoTPO pave the way for evaluating and advancing reasoning in video generation models, setting a foundation for future research in this emerging field.",

      "abstract": "Hospitals and healthcare systems rely on operational decisions that determine patient flow, cost, and quality of care. Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the principles that govern dynamical systems is a central challenge across many scientific domains, including biology and ecology. Incomplete knowledge of nonlinear interactions and stochastic effects often renders bottom-up modeling approaches ineffective, motivating the development of methods that can discover governing equations directly from data. In such contexts, parametric models often struggle without strong prior knowledge, especially when estimating intrinsic noise. Nonetheless, incorporating stochastic effects is often essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), a nonparametric, kernel-based framework that infers state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data. Trine features a three-stage algorithm that com- bines analytically solvable subproblems with a structured kernel architecture that captures both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. We validate Trine on biological and ecological systems, demonstrating its ability to uncover hidden dynamics without relying on predefined parametric assumptions. Across several benchmark problems, Trine achieves performance comparable to that of an oracle. Biologically, this oracle can be viewed as an idealized observer capable of directly tracking the random fluctuations in molecular concentrations or reaction events within a cell. The Trine framework thus opens new avenues for understanding how intrinsic noise affects the behavior of complex systems.",

In this study we analyze the evolution of ion distributions around a reformation cycle of a quasi-parallel shock. We use multi-point in-situ observations in the foreshock region of the Earths bow shock of a transient foreshock structure as it generates a shock. We find that backstreaming ions in the foreshock create a density and magnetic field depletion known as caviton which locally changes the shock geometry. Gyrating suprathermal ions that emerge within the caviton and reach the upstream edge of the core create a cross-field current imbalance that results in the nonlinear growth of a new shock layer. The new shock forms from the background foreshock fields over a distance of ~6 ion inertial lengths ($l_i$) and within 4.5 to 11.2 $l_i$ from the main bow shock. We find that plasma compression at the new thin shock layer is due to compactification of the cold upstream ion beam by high amplitude magnetic field-aligned electrostatic fields. At later stages, the plasma compression expands to form a new sheath.",

Through examples with $M$ of dimension two, three, and four, we illustrate recurring themes in compactifications -- for instance, the important roles played by Kaluza-Klein modes, and how the generalized symmetries (including higher-group and non-invertible ones) of $T[M]$, together with their anomalies, arise from non-trivial combinations of the parent 6d symmetries and the geometric structures of the internal manifold. For each dimension, we also focus on several topics that are especially interesting in that setting. These include: for 2-manifolds, the geometry of the \"full moduli space\" of $T[M_2]$ and its interaction with polarizations and symmetries; for 3-manifolds, the effect of torsion in homology on the spectrum of line operators in $T[M_3]$, together with applications to the study of quantum invariants such as $\\hat Z_a(M_3, q)$; and for 4-manifolds, predictions for VOA$[M_4]$ following from symmetries of $T[M_4]$, as well as the construction of a new invariant of 4-manifolds that depends on two \"$q$-parameters.\" Along the way, we discuss a range of topics that are of independent interest, such as how non-invertible symmetries in higher dimensions can become invertible under compactification, how to classify defects in quantum field theory via their response to a change of framing, and the interplay between $\\hat Z_a$ and volume conjectures.",

      "abstract": "We study the rational homology of the Deligne-Mumford compactification $\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}$ of the moduli space of stable curves via a family of Morse functions, the $\\text{sys}_T$ functions, which encode geometric information about short geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces. Exploiting the Morse-theoretic properties of $\\text{sys}_T$, including the existence of an index gap and the behavior of critical points near boundary strata, we prove that in low degrees the homology of $\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}$ is supported entirely on the boundary $\\partial \\mathcal M_{g,n}$.\n  Furthermore, we establish finite generation and stability phenomena for the rational homology across all genera and numbers of marked points. Using stable graphs and explicit attaching maps, we show that for each fixed degree $k$, a finite set of critical points generates all $k$-th homology classes via attaching stable graphs of stratum dimension $0$. This result recovers previously known stability in the genus direction, such as Tosteson's theorem, and provides a concrete, geometric construction of homology generators. Our approach unifies combinatorial, geometric, and Morse-theoretic techniques to give a comprehensive picture of the low-degree and stable homology of $\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}$.",

We present and analyse the detailed physical properties of six binary stellar systems, originally proposed as possible star-black hole binaries on the basis of radial velocities from Gaia's third data release, but soon recognised as likely post-mass-transfer binary systems with stripped companions. Methods. We used multi-epoch high-resolution FEROS spectra and spectral disentangling paired with stellar templates to derive effective temperatures, $T_\\mathrm{eff}$; stellar radii, R*; and projected rotational velocities, v$\\sin{i}$ for both components in all systems along with the mass ratio, q = $M_\\mathrm{accretor}/M_\\mathrm{donor}$ and the components' flux ratio as a function of wavelength. Results. Our analysis directly confirms that all systems are post-mass-transfer binaries with two luminous stars, i.e. no black hole companions. Each system contains an A-type accretor component that is rapidly rotating and a cooler very low-mass donor (~ 0.25M$\\odot$) that is overluminous. Five of the systems show no trace of any emission lines, implying that there is no current mass transfer, consistent with our inferred radii, in all cases within the Roche volume. The data are generally consistent with stable case AB mass transfer with $β$ (the fraction of mass lost from the accretor) less than 0.7. While the accretor components rotate rapidly, they rotate well below the critical rotation rate, $v_\\mathrm{crit}$, even though there must have been enough mass transfer to spin them up to a significant fraction of $v_\\mathrm{crit}$, according to theoretical models of angular momentum transfer. As neither magnetic braking nor tidal synchronisation should have been effective in spinning down the stars, our results suggest that either mass accretion does not increase the angular momentum of the accretors to their critical values or the systems never reached these values in the first place.",

      "abstract": "Indian poetry, known for its linguistic complexity and deep cultural resonance, has a rich and varied heritage spanning thousands of years. However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language. Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages. By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience.",

The source exhibits a stable flux across the entire exposure with no detectable pulsations by any instrument on their X-ray light curves, placing pulsed-fraction upper limits of 10% and 32% for XMM$-$Newton and NuSTAR, respectively. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by two thermal components consistent with the emission from an accretion disk, and shows a weak high-energy tail above 10 keV, with no statistical requirement for an additional nonthermal component. The unabsorbed $0.3-20$ keV luminosity is ${\\sim}2\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, evidencing the ULX nature of the source. The parameters obtained from spectral modeling are consistent with the hard ultraluminous state. Despite the fact that a neutron-star accretor cannot be ruled out by the available data, under the assumption that the compact object in NGC 5055 ULX X-1 is a black hole accreting through a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure-supported disk that drives an optically thick wind, we constrained its putative mass to $11-26$ M$_{\\odot}$.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we tackle the challenging task of predicting secondary structures from protein primary sequences, a pivotal initial stride towards predicting tertiary structures, while yielding crucial insights into protein activity, relationships, and functions. Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement. To assess our model's performance, we employed the training dataset provided by NetSurfP-2.0, which outlines secondary structure in 3-and 8-states. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model, SSRGNet surpasses the baseline on f1-scores.",

      "abstract": "We introduce GS-Light, an efficient, textual position-aware pipeline for text-guided relighting of 3D scenes represented via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). GS-Light implements a training-free extension of a single-input diffusion model to handle multi-view inputs. Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines.

      "abstract": "Materials with large second-order nonlinearities are crucial for next-generation integrated photonics. Spontaneously oriented organic thin films prepared by physical vapor deposition offer a promising poling-free and scalable approach. This study investigates molecular engineering strategies to enhance the second-order nonlinear response of derivatives based on the donor-acceptor molecule 2-(4'-diphenylaminobiphenyl-4-yl)quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (TPA-QCN). Four derivatives incorporating modifications designed to increase molecular hyperpolarizability ($β$) or promote favorable orientation were synthesized and characterized. The most successful modification, intramolecular bridge-locking, simultaneously increases hyperpolarizability and enhances spontaneous orientation by reducing detrimental electrostatic interactions during deposition. It leads to a significant enhancement of the second-order nonlinear response, achieving off-resonance $χ^{(2)}_{31} \\approx 16$ pm V$^{-1}$ and $χ^{(2)}_{33} \\approx 18$ pm V$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm, a twofold improvement over the parent TPA-QCN. Analysis combining nonlinear optical measurements, surface potential measurement, optical anisotropy, and density functional theory calculations indicates that improved molecular orientation, rather than increased $β$ alone, is the primary driver for the enhanced performance in the leading derivatives. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of targeting molecular orientation via structural design and position spontaneously oriented organic films as compelling poling-free candidates for integrated nonlinear photonic applications where the increased electrode-induced optical losses, fabrication complexity and footprint are a critical limitation.",

We formulate this joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints dictate the resulting similarity between the parameters of the different models, allowing the estimated parameters to differ across tasks while still combining information from multiple data sources. This framework enables knowledge transfer from tasks with abundant data to those with scarce data, leading to more accurate and reliable parameter estimates, providing a solution for scenarios where parameter inference from limited data is critical. We provide theoretical guarantees in a controlled framework with Gaussian data, and show the efficiency of our cross-learning method in applications with real data including image classification and propagation of infectious diseases.",

To analyze how individual publication choices both respond to and shape venue impact, we introduce a game-theoretic framework, coined the Publication Choice Problem, that captures this two-way interplay. We show the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in the Publication Choice Problem and its uniqueness under binary researcher types. Our characterizations of the equilibrium properties offer insights about what publication behaviors better indicate a researcher's impact level. Through equilibrium analysis, we further investigate how labeling papers with ``spotlight'' affects the impact factor of venues in the research community. Our analysis shows that competitive venue labeling top papers with ``spotlight'' may decrease the overall impact of other venues in the community, while less competitive venues with ``spotlight'' labeling have the opposite impact.",

Our ZAPT2 frozen natural orbital (ZAPT-FNO) selection scheme significantly outperforms the canonical molecular orbital virtual space truncation scheme based on Hartree-Fock orbital energies, especially when using large multiple-polarized and augmented basis sets. We demonstrate that the ZAPT-FNO-selected virtual orbitals lead to a systematic convergence of the correlation energies, but more importantly to the singlet-triplet T$_1$-S$_ 0$ energy gaps with respect to the complete active space (CAS) [occupied + virtual] size. We confirm our findings by simulating T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps in H$_2$O$_2$ and O$_2$ molecules using the traditional complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) approach, as well as in stretched CH$_2$, for which we also employed the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method as a quantum eigensolver. Finally, we applied the iQCC method with ZAPT-FNO-selected active space to the phosphorescent Ir(ppy)$_3$ complex with 260 electrons, where extended basis sets are required to achieve chemical (ca. 1 m$E_h$) accuracy. In this case, CASCI results are not available; however, the iQCC-computed T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps show robust convergence with enlarging basis set and CAS size, approaching the experimental value. Thus, the ZAPT-FNO method is very promising for improving the accuracy of quantum chemical modelling in a resource-efficient manner, and opens the door to simulating open-shell states of large materials within realistic active space sizes and without compromising on basis-set quality.",

A notable example is checkpointing and restarting, which is essential for long-running simulations to recover from failures, resume after interruptions, or examine intermediate results.

Operator theory, in contrast, studies linear and multilinear transformations in functional spaces, forming the analytic backbone of modern analysis and quantum mechanics, with applications ranging from signal processing and control theory to data science. This paper explores the synergy between these two areas by showing how operator theory provides concrete analytic structures that naturally enrich multicategories, while multicategory theory supplies a unifying framework for organizing multi-input operators and ensuring coherence in complex networks. We develop a comprehensive categorical framework integrating operator theory with multicategories, introducing a symmetric monoidal multicategory of Hilbert spaces with bounded multilinear maps and establishing its enrichment and coherence properties. The framework includes a functorial spectral theorem, covariance under unitary transformations, and universality as a semantic target, providing a unified language for linking analytic structure, categorical semantics, and operator representations.

      "abstract": "This article develops the concept of Person-AI bidirectional fit, defined as the continuously evolving, context-sensitive alignment-primarily cognitive, but also emotional and behavioral-between a human decision-maker and an artificial intelligence system. Grounded in contingency theory and quality theory, the study examines the role of P-AI fit in managerial decision-making through a proof-of-concept case study involving a real hiring process for a Senior AI Lead. Three decision pathways are compared: (1) independent evaluations by a CEO, CTO, and CSO; (2) an evaluation produced by an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system (H3LIX-LAIZA); and (3) an assessment generated by a general-purpose large language model. The results reveal substantial role-based divergence in human judgments, high alignment between H3LIX-LAIZA and the CEOs implicit decision model-including ethical disqualification of a high-risk candidate and a critical false-positive recommendation from the LLMr. The findings demonstrate that higher P-AI fit, exemplified by the CEO H3LIX-LAIZA relationship, functions as a mechanism linking augmented symbiotic intelligence to accurate, trustworthy, and context-sensitive decisions. The study provides an initial verification of the P-AI fit construct and a proof-of-concept for H3LIX-LAIZA as an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system.",

      "abstract": "Strongly lensed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with an observable time delay can be used to constrain the expansion history of the Universe through time-delay cosmography (TDC). As the sample of time-delay lenses grows to statistical size, with $\\mathcal{O}$(1000) lensed AGN forecast to be observed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), there is an emerging opportunity to use TDC as an independent probe of dark energy. To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample. We start from individual lenses, and emulate the full joint hierarchical TDC analysis, including image-based modeling, time-delay measurement, velocity dispersion measurement, and external convergence prediction. We fully account for the mass-sheet and mass-anisotropy degeneracies. We assume a sample of 800 lenses, with varying levels of follow-up fidelity based on existing campaigns. With our baseline assumptions, within a flexible $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, we simultaneously forecast a $\\sim$2.5% constraint on H0 and a dark energy figure of merit (DE FOM) of 6.7. We show that by expanding the sample from 50 lenses to include an additional 750 lenses with plausible LSST time-delay measurements, we improve the forecasted DE FOM by nearly a factor of 3, demonstrating the value of incorporating this portion of the sample. We also investigate different follow-up campaign strategies, and find significant improvements in the DE FOM with additional stellar kinematics measurements and higher-precision time-delay measurements. We also demonstrate how the redshift configuration of time-delay lenses impacts constraining power in $w_0w_a$CDM.",

      "abstract": "Interoception and exteroception provide continuous feedback about the body and the environment, yet how they are dynamically integrated within a unified predictive coding framework has remained under-specified. This paper develops and empirically validates an integrative predictive coding model that treats interoceptive and exteroceptive inference as parallel hierarchical systems exchanging precision-weighted prediction errors. Within this framework, arbitration between the two streams is governed by relative precision weights (w) and integrated within the anterior insula (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Computational simulations of the model reproduced biologically plausible dynamics: prediction errors decayed exponentially while arbitration weights self-normalized toward equilibrium (w = 0.5), demonstrating stable convergence and coherent integration. Simulated anxiety and PTSD profiles, characterized respectively by interoceptive and exteroceptive overweighting, yielded rigid, self-sustaining imbalances (w to 1 or w to 0) and slowed recalibration. Empirical application of the arbitration equation to published EEG-fMRI datasets further validated the model. The framework contributes a unifying account of how dysregulated precision weighting may underlie anxiety (overweighted interoception) and PTSD (underweighted interoception). Building on this validation, a proposed experimental paradigm is outlined to test the model's predictions in humans. It examines recalibration across anxiety, neutral, and PTSD groups following targeted interoceptive or exteroceptive therapies. Key predictions include identifiable neural markers of coherence, modulation of heartbeat-evoked potentials by vagal stimulation, and precision-sensitive behavioral signatures in interoceptive-exteroceptive congruency tasks.",

      "abstract": "Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $Λ$-Cold Dark Matter ($Λ$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $Λ$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $Λ$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.",

We first obtain a criterion which characterizes such extendable solutions in terms either of the electromagnetic invariants, or (equivalently) of the canonical Newman-Penrose form of the self-dual Maxwell field. This is then used to argue that all static configurations are extendable (more generally, all configurations admitting a non-null twistfree Killing vector field). One can thus draw from the extensive literature to straightforwardly extend to CINLE various known exact solutions, whereby the duality invariance of the Einstein-Maxwell theory allows for dyonic solutions even in more general theories. This is illustrated by a few explicit examples, including the homogeneous $Λ<0$ universe of Ozsváth, a black hole in the universe of Levi-Civita, Bertotti and Robinson, a generalization of the charged $C$-metric, and non-expanding gravitational waves in the Bonnor-Melvin background.",

We investigate whether modern LLMs can reduce this burden by leveraging them to synthesize sound, non-trivial abstract interpreters across multiple abstract domains in the setting of neural network verification. We formulate synthesis as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel mathematically grounded cost function for measuring unsoundness under strict syntactic and semantic constraints. Based on this formulation, we develop a unified framework that unifies LLM-based generation with syntactic and semantic validation and a quantitative cost-guided feedback mechanism. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework not only matches the quality of handcrafted transformers, but more importantly, discovers sound, high-precision transformers for complex nonlinear operators that are absent from existing literature.",

To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)'s Smart Forms & Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability. The presented case study demonstrates that ontology-driven M2M transformation can systematically bridge domain-specific workflows and standard notations, offering quantifiable performance and qualitative benefits for stakeholders.",

Machine learning classifiers can learn from large amounts of training examples to effectively distinguish deceptive reviews from genuine ones.

In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) to translate machine-learned lexical cues into human-understandable language phenomena that can differentiate deceptive reviews from genuine ones. We show that language phenomena obtained in this manner are empirically grounded in data, generalizable across similar domains, and more predictive than phenomena either in LLMs' prior knowledge or obtained through in-context learning. These language phenomena have the potential to aid people in critically assessing the credibility of online reviews in environments where deception detection classifiers are unavailable.",

      "abstract": "Fault tolerant quantum computation over distributed quantum computing (DQC) platforms requires careful evaluation of resource requirements and noise thresholds. As quantum hardware advances toward modular and networked architectures, various fault tolerant DQC schemes have been proposed, which can be broadly categorized into three architectural types. Type 1 architectures consist of small quantum nodes connected via Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, enabling nonlocal stabilizer measurements. Type 2 architectures distribute a large error correcting code block across multiple modules, with most stabilizer measurements remaining local, except for a small subset at patch boundaries that are performed using nonlocal CNOT gates. Type 3 architectures assign code blocks to distinct modules and can perform fault tolerant operations such as transversal gates, lattice surgery, and teleportation to implement logical operations between code blocks. Using the planar surface code and toric code as representative examples, we analyze how the resource requirements, particularly the number of Bell pairs and the average number of generation attempts, scale with increasing code distance across different architectural designs. This analysis provides valuable insights for identifying architectures well suited to fault tolerant distributed quantum computation under near term hardware and resource constraints.",

Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Our results reveal that distributed models benefit the most from hyperparameter tuning, achieving a remarkable tradeoff by simultaneously mitigating both attack types more effectively than other training setups.",

We train models to have more understandable circuits by constraining most of their weights to be zeros, so that each neuron only has a few connections. To recover fine-grained circuits underlying each of several hand-crafted tasks, we prune the models to isolate the part responsible for the task. These circuits often contain neurons and residual channels that correspond to natural concepts, with a small number of straightforwardly interpretable connections between them. We study how these models scale and find that making weights sparser trades off capability for interpretability, and scaling model size improves the capability-interpretability frontier. However, scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge. In addition to training weight-sparse models de novo, we show preliminary results suggesting our method can also be adapted to explain existing dense models.

NIRCam images and NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopy ($R=2700$) show that TGSSJ1530+1049 is part of one of the densest-known structures of continuum and line-emitting objects found at these redshifts. NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3''x3'' IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc^2 area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log($M_\\star/M_\\odot)>10.3$) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Using a stellar mass-based analysis, we predict a total dark matter halo mass of $\\approx10^{13} M_\\odot$. Based on the physical separations and velocity differences between the galaxies, it is expected that these galaxies will merge to form a massive galaxy within a few Gyr. The system qualitatively resembles the forming brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations that form early through a rapid succession of mergers.",

      "abstract": "Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills a pre-trained multi-step diffusion model to a few-step one to improve inference efficiency. However, the performance of the latter is often capped by the former. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose DMDR, a novel framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques into the distillation process. We show that for the RL of the few-step generator, the DMD loss itself is a more effective regularization compared to the traditional ones. In turn, RL can help to guide the mode coverage process in DMD more effectively. These allow us to unlock the capacity of the few-step generator by conducting distillation and RL simultaneously. Meanwhile, we design the dynamic distribution guidance and dynamic renoise sampling training strategies to improve the initial distillation process. The experiments demonstrate that DMDR can achieve leading visual quality, prompt coherence among few-step methods, and even exhibit performance that exceeds the multi-step teacher.",

      "abstract": "3D modeling is shifting from static visual representations toward physical, articulated assets that can be directly used in simulation and interaction. However, most existing 3D generation methods overlook key physical and articulation properties, thereby limiting their utility in embodied AI. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhysX-Anything, the first simulation-ready physical 3D generative framework that, given a single in-the-wild image, produces high-quality sim-ready 3D assets with explicit geometry, articulation, and physical attributes. Specifically, we propose the first VLM-based physical 3D generative model, along with a new 3D representation that efficiently tokenizes geometry. It reduces the number of tokens by 193x, enabling explicit geometry learning within standard VLM token budgets without introducing any special tokens during fine-tuning and significantly improving generative quality. In addition, to overcome the limited diversity of existing physical 3D datasets, we construct a new dataset, PhysX-Mobility, which expands the object categories in prior physical 3D datasets by over 2x and includes more than 2K common real-world objects with rich physical annotations. Extensive experiments on PhysX-Mobility and in-the-wild images demonstrate that PhysX-Anything delivers strong generative performance and robust generalization. Furthermore, simulation-based experiments in a MuJoCo-style environment validate that our sim-ready assets can be directly used for contact-rich robotic policy learning. We believe PhysX-Anything can substantially empower a broad range of downstream applications, especially in embodied AI and physics-based simulation.",

      "abstract": "We introduce Part-X-MLLM, a native 3D multimodal large language model that unifies diverse 3D tasks by formulating them as programs in a structured, executable grammar. Given an RGB point cloud and a natural language prompt, our model autoregressively generates a single, coherent token sequence encoding part-level bounding boxes, semantic descriptions, and edit commands. This structured output serves as a versatile interface to drive downstream geometry-aware modules for part-based generation and editing. By decoupling the symbolic planning from the geometric synthesis, our approach allows any compatible geometry engine to be controlled through a single, language-native frontend. We pre-train a dual-encoder architecture to disentangle structure from semantics and instruction-tune the model on a large-scale, part-centric dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our model excels at producing high-quality, structured plans, enabling state-of-the-art performance in grounded Q\\&A, compositional generation, and localized editing through one unified interface.
